## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

## Prerequisite

[*18.02 Multivariable Calculus*](https://ocw-studio.odl.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010)

## Course Description

This course introduces students to probability and random variables. Topics include distribution functions, binomial, geometric, hypergeometric, and Poisson distributions. The other topics covered are uniform, exponential, normal, gamma and beta distributions; conditional probability; Bayes theorem; joint distributions; Chebyshev inequality; law of large numbers; and central limit theorem.

## Course Numbering

Until spring 2015, the course now called 18.600 was called 18.440. It was renamed as part of a departmental effort to make course labels more logical. The current label conveys that 18.600 is a foundational class and a starting point for the 18.6xx series.
